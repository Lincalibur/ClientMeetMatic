Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
On Windows:
• python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
• python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required packages:
• pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Configure the Google Maps API Key

Open the src/main.py file in a text editor.
Replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' with your actual Google Maps API key:

• API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY'

Save and close the file.

Step 5: Run the Script

Ensure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated (if used).
Run the script:

• python src/main.py

The script will read the client data from the Excel file, calculate distances, and schedule appointments in Outlook based on priority.
Troubleshooting

Python not recognized: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
Google Maps API errors: Verify that your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
Outlook issues: Ensure Outlook is installed and configured properly on your system.
